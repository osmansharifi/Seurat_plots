# Single-nucleus RNA-seq 5â€™ reveals cell-to-cell heterogeneity in Rett Syndrome mouse brain temporally

This pipeline is developed to analyze 10X single nucleus RNA-seq 5' data from mouse brain. It includes mapping of reads via cellranger, preprocessing, DEG analysis, gene ontology analysis, trajectory analysis and velocity analysis.


## Study Design

|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| **Mouse Age**      | E18               | P30                | P60               |      P120/P150    |
| **Brain Region**   | whole brain       |Cortex/Hypothalamus |Cortex/Hypothalamus|Cortex/Hypothalamus|
| **Sex**            | M/F               | M/F                |    M/F            |         M/F       |
